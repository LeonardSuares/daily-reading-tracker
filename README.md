# Daily Reading Tracker

**Data-Driven Python Project**
A collection of utility-focused application built with Python, Pandas, and Streamlit, emphasizing data persistence, logic-based tracking, and specialized data serialization.

**Daily and Weekly Bible Reading Trackers**

**The Problem:** Standard reading plans are passive. **The Solution:** A two-tier tracking system that turns personal habits into quantifiable data.

**Technical Highlights:**

**Data Persistence:** Managed via a CRUD-capable CSV backend.

**Logic-Based Streaks:** Implemented a "Gaps and Islands" algorithm to calculate contiguous reading chains, resetting automatically if a 24-hour window is missed.

**Dashboarding:** Integrated Matplotlib and Streamlit for real-time progress visualization and "Catch-up" analysis for missed entries.
